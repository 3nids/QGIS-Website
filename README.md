QGIS-Website
============

Website is a static generated website using Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/), 
based on restructured text sources (rst: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
and html (jinja2) templates.

Most sources are in source/site. Only frontpage and landingpages are in theme/qgis-theme

Styling is in theme/qgis-theme. This theme is used for website and documentation builds. 
The Website version is the canonical one.

Building the website using Make
-------------------------------

Building is only tested on Linux systems using make, on windows we now started a Paver setup (seel below)

To be able to run localisation targets you will need Sphinx 1.2b3 which comes with pip. 
Sphinx coming with most distro's is just 1.1.3. You will get an gettext error with those.

Best to run the make file in a virtual env ( http://www.virtualenv.org/ ):

Move to a directory (~/myvirtualenvs/) and create a virtualenv enabled dir:

    virtualenv sphinx  # one time action, only to create the environment
    cd sphinx

And activate this virtualenv

    source bin/activate 
    # now you will see sphinx before your prompt:
    (sphinx)richard@mymachine

Now always activate your environment before building. To deactivate, you can do:

    deactivate

You can install all tools in on go via the REQUIREMENTS.txt here in root of this repo:

    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt

Alternatively do it one by one:

Install sphinx 1.2b3 now in your virtual env:

    pip install sphinx==1.2b3

Sphinx intl extention ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-intl ):

    pip install sphinx-intl

Then build:

    make html (to build the english languag)
    make LANG=nl html (to build the dutch version. Currently available: ca_ES  da_DK  de  en  es  fa  fi  fr  hi  id  it  ja  km_KH  ko_KR  nl  pt_PT  ro  ru  zh_CN  zh_TW)

If you want add the QGIS-Documentation docs into the build, you either need to manually copy the sources, resources 
and po files into the website project. Or use the fullhtml target of make (which will checkout the 2.0 branch):

    # to build english:
    make fullhtml
    # to build eg dutch:
    make LANG=nl fullhtml

To gather new strings in a pot (.po) file for your language, and merge them with 
excisting translations in the po files (normally to be ran by your language maintainer):

    make pretranslate LANG=xx  # where xx is your language code

To add a new language (the scripts will need some directory structure):

    make createlang LANG=xx

See the website in action: http://www.qgis.org


Building the website using Paver
--------------------------------

Paver is a python based Make-like tool (http://paver.github.io/paver/)

Paver can be used on Linux and Windows.

There are two scripts available:

- bootstrap.py (for setting up the python related stuff)
- pavement.py (the config file for Paver)

General use:

    # first let bootstrap.py install all stuff    
    python bootstrap.py
    
    # if the script is complaining about easysetup missing:
    # download: https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
    # and install that first:
    python ez_setup.py

    # after succesfull running of bootstrap.py you have all wheels on place to
    # 1) create a virtual environment with all Sphinx related python machinery
    # 2) run the actual script to build the website
    
    # to go into the virtual environment:
    # on Windows:
    virtualenv\Scripts\activate
    # on Linux:
    source virtualenv/bin/activate
    
    # now build (only website, no included Documentation yet):
    # eg english only:
    paver html
    # or the dutch version:
    paver html -l nl
    # german:
    paver html -l de
    
    
    
Styling the website
-------------------

Most javascript and css is in theme/qgis-style/ files.

theme/qgis-style/qgis-style.css is based on Less (see http://lesscss.org/ )

To make changes to CSS on MacOsx
 
    download / install / open Less app (http://incident57.com/less/)
    in Finder navigate to themes/qgis-theme/static/
    drag qgis-style.less file to the Less app
    make changes in qgis-style.less
    on save it should automatically compile into qgis-style.css
    for advance usage read docs on Less CSS: http://lesscss.org/

    (if you have any questions ping yulka_plekhanova on Skype)

To make changes on cli Linux

    # install node-less and the compressor
    sudo apt-get install node-less yui-compressor
    # compile the less file to a normal css file:
    lessc qgis-style.less qgis-style.css
    # or
    lessc qgis-style.less > qgis-style.css
    # optional: compress the css
    yui-compressor -o qgis-style.css qgis-style.css
