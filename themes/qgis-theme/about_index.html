<h2>My Fancy Landing page in full html for About and Discover</h2>

<p>
note that for this page/part of the website to show up in the tocs in the sidebar,
you'll need a toc in the rst counterpart of this one.
</p>

<p>
At this moment there is a sidebar on this landingpage, but that will be removed
later. So this is a fancy landing page, and when you go to one of it child pages,
eg case_studies/index.html or sponsoring.html (which are real rst pages), the 
sidebar should appear.
