<p>
note that for this page/part of the website to show up in the tocs in the sidebar,
you'll need a toc in the rst counterpart of this one.
</p>

<p>
In conf.py the sidebar is removed from this page. So this is a fancy landing page, and when you go to one of it child pages,
eg case_studies/index.html or sponsoring.html (which are real rst pages), the 
sidebar should appear.
</p>

<p>
The idea is that from here you'll go with nice images, buttons or whatever to real pages which should have sitebars:<br/>
<a href="{{ pathto('about/case_studies/index') }}">Nice graphics for Case studies</a><br/>
<a href="{{ pathto('about/sponsorship') }}">Go to page sponsorship</a><br/>
<a href="{{ pathto('about/screenshots') }}">Screenshot page</a><br/>
</p>
