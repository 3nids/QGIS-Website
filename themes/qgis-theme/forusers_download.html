<h2>Fancy Download page in html, will be without left menu (done in conf.py)</h2>

<p>
The idea is that from here you see the downloads for average user, buttons or whatever<br/>
Besides that, we have page for all available downloads:<br/>
<a href="{{ pathto('forusers/alldownloads') }}">All downloads</a><br/>
</p>
