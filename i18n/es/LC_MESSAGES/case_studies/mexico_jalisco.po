"Within the years, the institution has gathered loads of information in "
"several formats such as SHP, DWG, DXF, GeoTIFF and ECW, among others. So, "
"what we wanted was to have all this information available, organized and in "
"a common format with the purpose of being able to provide and display it "

"I decided to use Mapserver and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension to be able "
"to deliver our satellite imagery, orthopothos, digital elevation models and "
"vector information with Web Map Services, thinking that any application will"
" consume our services. But the problem was that many of the commercial and "
"free applications don’t work with OGC standards, specially with WFS. After "
"exploring many geographic information systems, I realized that QGIS was the "
"only one which can connect to WMS, WCS and WFS successfully."

"Internally, we use QGIS to check the raster and vector data of the agencies "
"before publishing it, and after its integration, we used it again to test "
"the Web services that we’ve created. Also, we have done many spatial "
"analysis with QGIS pulling the data directly from our PostgreSQL spatial "
"database, then, we export the results as shape files."
