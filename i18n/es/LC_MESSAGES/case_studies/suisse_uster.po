"The City of Uster has been using QGIS since 2007. Encouraged by the decision"
" of the Kanton of Solothurn to use QGIS as a Desktop GIS replacement for "
"ArcView, Uster decided to also give it a try. The city joined the effort for"
" the further development of the QGIS application, by suggesting and testing "
"new features and by financially supporting the development. In return Uster "
"receives a rapidly evolving and platform independent Desktop GIS and WebGIS "
"solution backed by a worldwide user and development community."

"Postgis/PostgreSQL is used as a central geodata warehouse. Other databases "
"and data sources are replicated into PostgreSQL at a regular interval, using"
" tools such as OGR and FME. In the beginning QGIS was mainly used as a "
"viewer. The first QGIS user was a farmer who had the task of supervising the"
" declarations made by local farmers for receiving agricultural subsidies. "
"Later, QGIS was also introduced as a data editor and map publishing "
"platform, along with the improvements of the editing tools and the print "
"composer. Together with other Swiss QGIS users (Solothurn, Thun and CDE "
"(University of Berne)) we coordinate and sponsor the improvements of these "
"tools, along with some improvements in data driven symbolization, automated "
"labeling, attribute handling and forms."

"The city administration also uses commercial GIS software: Autodesk "
"Topobase, for the capturing and editing of cadastral and waste-water "
"infrastructure data, and GE Smallworld for the management of gas, water and "
"electricity networks. However, these are expert systems in use by specially "
"trained staff. All other GIS projects and the viewing of all data is handled"
" by QGIS."

"In the second half of 2010, first tests with QGIS server were carried out. "
"In 2011 we introduced a new WebGIS system based on the QGIS WMS server and "
"GeoExt/OpenLayers as the web client. The main reasons for the decision to "
"use QGIS server were the considerable time savings made possible by re-using"
" the existing QGIS desktop project configurations, rather than having to "
"manage parallel Web project configurations. Additional advantages are the "
"rich set of symbolization and labeling options and the consistent map "
"rendering between the Desktop GIS application and the Web-GIS. The QGIS "
"webclient can be tested and used at http://gis.uster.ch/"

"In 2007 it was not entirely clear at what pace QGIS would be further "
"developed and how both community and commercial support would evolve. Today "
"it can be stated that the speed of development and the improvements made by "
"the QGIS community exceeded our expectations. Community and commercial "
"support from the companies Sourcepole and Norbit is excellent. There is a "
"direct communication with developers without being shielded away by a "
"product management or sales team. The developers of these two companies are "
"also lead developers of the QGIS project and have excellent knowledge of the"
" code base."

"Bugs are often fixed within hours or days after reporting and new "
"developments are implemented in a short time frame. New features can be "
"tested immediately after development and deployed to the users whenever the "
"quality is good enough for the end user. There is no need to wait for "
"official software releases. We enjoy the freedom of being able to influence "
"the project and to install the software on as many computers we like without"
" having to deal with licensing management. We are looking forward to future "
"collaboration with the QGIS community and our commercial supporters for the "
"advancement of the QGIS project."
