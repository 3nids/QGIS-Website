"An interdisciplinary group of researchers based at the University of North "
"Carolina have been working in the Burgundy region of France for over 30 "
"years. We are trying to understand the changing patterns of human settlement"
" and land use over a period of 2,000 years from the Iron Age, Gallo-Roman, "
"Medieval periods into the present.  Our project has included a wide variety "
"of disciplinary researchers, and part of our project includes how to conduct"
" such long-duration interdisciplinary research activities. GIS, GPS and "
"remote sensing have been integral to our work, and our GIS database was "
"first created in 1986, one of the first such archaeological applications.  "
"We have done archaeological, historical, geological, ecological, and "
"ethnographic research in the area surrounding the commune of Uxeau, in "
"Southern Burgundy, which is a rich and resilient landscape that has "
"maintained productivity and stability for an extended period."
msgstr "Um grupo interdisciplinar de investigadores situado na Universidade da Carolina do Norte tem vindo a trabalhar na  Borgonha região de França à mais de 30 anos. Nós estamos a tentar entender o padrão de mudanças do alojamento humano e uso do solo acerca de 2.000 anos desde os períodos da Idade do Ferro, Galeco-Romano, Medievais até ao presente. O nosso projecto inclui uma ampla variedade de investigadores disciplinares, e parte do nosso projecto inclui formas de conduzir essas actividades interdisciplinares de investigação de longa duração. Os SIG, o GPS e a detecção remota têm sido parte integrante do nosso trabalho, sendo a nossa base de dados SIG criada pela primeira vez em 1986, uma das primeiras aplicações arqueológicos. Temos feito investigação arqueológica, histórica, geológica, ecológica e etnográfica na área em torno da comuna de Uxeau, no sul da Borgonha, que é uma paisagem rica e flexível que tem mantido uma produtividade e estabilidade por um longo período."

"Our research, organized by the theoretical framework of Historical Ecology, "
"centers on the interaction of people, their societies, natural and built "
"environments, and how these have changed over time. Using a collection of "
"historical maps of the area dating back to 1659, we have scanned, digitized "
"and extracted features for a total of 21 maps into our extensive project GIS"
" database. Features in our database include land cover (forest, vineyards, "
"pasture and agriculturecropland), ponds and streams, mills, roads and "
"buildings from these different dates, where possible. We also have cadastral"
" parcel data from 1834, 1964 and 2012, giving us detailed data on changing "
"patterns of detailed land use for the commune of Uxeau (see location in "
"Figure 1). Our project is interdisciplinary, and we have conduced extensive "
"field surveys, oral history and ethnographic interviews, documentary "
"research in various librariesarchives, and geological and ecological "
"analysis (see Figure 3)."

"An important feature of this landscape is water, and that is one of the "
"fociuses of our current research. The area is interlaced with streams that "
"have been dammed to form ponds, many dating to at least the middle ages. The"
" creation and maintenance of these ponds with their earthen dams required a "
"great deal of labor and expense. Our research has shown that these man-made "
"ponds were used to water livestock, raise fish for domestic consumption and "
"sale, launder clothing, soak hemp for processing, and for recreation. One of"
" the most important functions of ponds in the past was to run mills, "
"primarily for grinding grain, but also for pressing oil and cutting lumber. "
"Many of these mills have disappeared and many of the surviving mill "
"buildings are endangered due to neglect or redevelopment. Our recent field "
"survey of ponds and mill sites identified from the historical maps was "
"designed to document the remaining pond and mill sites, verify our "
"historical data, test new GIS and GPS technologies, and better understand "
"the conditions and changing function of these features in the present "
"economy."

"pond and mill sites. Our work has documented 52 ponds and 27 mills in the "

"Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years ago, "
"there has been many requests in the research community outside the institute"
" to share this product, and we started to develop a public and improved "

"Our project started using GRASS in 1986, and has continued to use this, as "
"well as commercial ArcGIS and a variety of other tools such as Photoshop, "
"Garmin’s BaseCamp, eVis and others. With many collaborators at various "
"institutions in the US and Europe, and graduate students coming and going, "
"using free and open source tools makes a lot of sense. We have found that "
"the combination of QGIS and GRASS provides capable data analysis and "
"visualization, ease of use, interoperability, and portability for our "
"project. Archaeologists have had a strong presence in the GRASS and open "
"source GIS communities for many years, and have contributed much to this "
"important effort, developing and sharing many capabilities. I have taught "
"several 4-day QGIS/GRASS/R short courses in France over the years, sharing "
"these tools with many archaeologists from throughout France."
