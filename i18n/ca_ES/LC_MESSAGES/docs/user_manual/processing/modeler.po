msgid "The *graphical modeler* allows to create complex models using a simple and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis operations are not isolated, but part of a chain of operations instead. Using the graphical modeler, that chain of processes can be wrapped into a single process, so it is easier and more convenient to execute than a single process later on a different set on inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms it involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm, thus saving time and effort, specially for larger models."
