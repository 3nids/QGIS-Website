msgid ":guilabel:`Use filename as layer name`. The name of each resulting layer created by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm itself. In some cases, a fixed name might be used, that meaning that the same name will be used, no matter which input layer is used. In other cases, the name might depend on the name of the input layer or some of the parameters used to run the algorithm. If this checkbox is checked, the name will be taken from the output filename instead. Notice, that, if the output is saved to a temporary file, the filename of this temporary file is usually long and meaningless one intended to avoid collision with other already existing filenames."

They contain an :guilabel:`Activate` item that you can use to make algorithms appear or not in the toolbox.
