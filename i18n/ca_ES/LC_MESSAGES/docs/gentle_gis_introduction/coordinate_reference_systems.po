"When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However "
"when viewed from space, we can see that the earth is relatively spherical. "
"Maps, as we will see in the upcoming map production topic, are "
"representations of reality. They are designed to not only represent "
"features, but also their shape and spatial arrangement. Each map projection "
"has **advantages** and **disadvantages**. The best projection for a map "
"depends on the **scale** of the map, and on the purposes for which it will "
"be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable distortions if used "
"to map the entire African continent, but may be an excellent choice for a "
"**large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. The properties of a map "
"projection may also influence some of the design features of the map. Some "
"projections are good for small areas, some are good for mapping areas with a "
"large East-West extent, and some are better for mapping areas with a large "

"The process of creating map projections can be visualised by positioning a "

"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have "
"the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they "
"represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference "

"projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when "
"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for "
"example, you are trying to analyse a particular area in your town to find "
"out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "
"are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an "
"equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
"area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when "
"dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their "
"angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "
