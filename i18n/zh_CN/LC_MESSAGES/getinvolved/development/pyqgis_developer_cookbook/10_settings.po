"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at particular machine. "
"QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main window size "
"or default snapping tolerance. This functionality is provided directly by Qt"
" framework by the means of QSettings class. By default, this class stores "
"settings in system's \"native\" way of storing settings, that is --- "
"registry (on Windows), .plist file (on Mac OS X) or .ini file (on Unix). The"
" `QSettings documentation <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/qsettings.html>`_ "
"is comprehensive, so we will provide just a simple example::"

"Qt uses QVariant instances for variable values in setValue() and value() "
"methods. Your values are automagically converted from Python to QVariant "
"instances, however the conversion from QVariant to Python is not automatic: "
"that's why we use the to*() methods. Few more things to note here:"
