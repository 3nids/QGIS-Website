"LEAG plays important role in academic research held in College of Business "
"and Hotel Management. The need of spatial modeling requires also excellent "
"software. The philosophy of minimum cost and maximum efficiency led to "
"choice of open source solutions. This step resulted in using core open "
"source SW such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape and QGIS. QGIS does not stand "
"alone – we use MapWindow, OpenJump, gvSIG, SAGA and others. But QGIS plays "
"the major role."

"QGIS is used with synergy to other open source products. For example the "
"final layout is mostly create using Inkscape or GIMP (less in LibreOffice "
"Draw). Web-based maps are editing using Inkscape (after SVG export) and "
"raster maps are pre-edited using GIMP. QGIS is also great educational tool. "
"College of Business and Hotel Management offers students subjects like "
"“Geographical Information Systems I. and II.” or “Selected chapters from "
"geoinformatic literacy” where QGIS is used as main platform for teaching "
"students how to use GIS and how to produce high-quality maps. Recently, the "
"QGIS was used as main product during GIS Day held at our school on November "

"QGIS large databases are being created and further testing of new functions "
