"The Iberian wolf is a sub-species of the gray wolf that exists only in north"
" of Portugal and Spain, with small isolated groups in the south of Douro "
"river. During the last century, it suffered a high regression, being a "
"“vulnerable” species in Spain and “endangered” in Portugal. Nowadays, there "
"are only around 300 wolves in Portugal,  due to the high persecution, "
"destruction and fragmentation of the habitat."

"Ribeira de Pena is a municipality in the Vila Real district in the north of "
"Portugal. It is a rural municipality, characterized by agriculture, grazing "
"livestock, forest, mountains, valleys and diverse fauna, along with low "
"human density, that provides shelter and food for wolves. Located in a zone "
"of transition between the harsh and mountainous Trás-os-Montes and the "
"verdant Minho, Ribeira de Pena is one of the municipalities that can work "
"like an ecological corridor between areas with higher wolf concentration in "
"the north with lower concentration in the south."

"Meanwhile, I entered in the new world of Linux. After that I was contacted "
"to help some researchers to model ecological corridors for wolves in Ribeira"
" de Pena, using GIS, since they never worked with this kind of software. "
"Because I was already using Linux instead of windows, my first problem was "
"which software to use. Then I heard about QGIS and decided to give it a try,"
" although it seemed very simplistic and incomplete, when compared to what I "
"already knew. I quickly realized how mistaken I was, and got really "
"enthusiastic with the analytical capabilities QGIS provided, specially with "
"GRASS integration."

"To model the ecological corridors, we used the QGIS along with the GRASS "
"plugin. We used several geographic information along with presence data of "
"the species to model the ecological corridors. Here are some of the "
"functions of both QGIS and GRASS used in this case, just to name a few: * "
"plugin Interpolation in QGIS: to create a Digital Elevation Model * "
"r.watershed in GRASS: to create water streams from DEM * r.grow.distance in "
"GRASS: generates a raster map layer of distance to features in input layer *"
" r.reclass in GRASS: to reclassify map layers * r.slope.aspect.slope in "
"GRASS: to calculate the slope from the DEM * r.mapcalculator in GRASS: to "
"calculate some simple map algebra * r.cost.coord in GRASS: creates a raster "
"map showing the cumulative cost of moving between different geographic "
"locations on an input raster map whose cell category values represent cost *"
" r.drain in GRASS: Traces a flow through an elevation model on a raster map "
"– the one used to create the corridors With this work we obtained a map with"
" the potential ecological corridors for wolf in Ribeira de Pena "
"municipality. These are areas to be considered by the city council "
"technicians when planning conservation measures for the species. These "
"corridors are of extreme importance because they can connect the fragile "
"wolf packs in Vila Real in the south with those in the north, which are "
"continuous with those from Peneda-Gerês and Spain far more stable. It is "
"from particular importance those corridors that cross human settlements, "
"like small villages, cities and roads. These areas must be considered "
"critical for wolf conservation, and applied measures to reduce human impact "
"in this species."

"Both QGIS and plugin GRASS are very intuitive with user-friendly interface, "
"with all essential functions to perform most analysis. For what I could see,"
" QGIS and GRASS perform equally as well as the proprietary programs I was "
"most familiar with from college days, with the big advantage of free open-"
"source software, usable in every computer or notebook without licenses, "
"constant upgrades and the ultimate advantage to contribute to it's "
"improvement and/or tip the developers about some essential function."

"Changing to Linux and then to QGIS and GRASS was one of my best calls, and "
"although there can be some missing issues, easily resolved in the future "
"with the developers, I don't regret my decision and advise everyone to use "
