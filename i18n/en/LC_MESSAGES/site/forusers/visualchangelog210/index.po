"This is the next release in our 4-monthly release series. It gives you early"
" access to the new features we have been working on and represents the "
"'cutting edge' of QGIS development. If you are working in a production "
"environment where you wish to be more conservative about rolling out new "
"features to your users, we also provide a Long Term Release (LTR) version of"
" QGIS. The current LTR is version 2.8.2 and is available at "
"`download.qgis.org <http://download.qgis.org>`__. LTR releases will be "
"supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in permanent "
"feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug fixes and "
"trivial updates). The features provided in QGIS 2.10 'Pisa' will be included"
" in the next LTR release (slated for release in 2016), so using this release"
" provides you with an excellent opportunity to test new features that will "
"make their way into the next LTR."
