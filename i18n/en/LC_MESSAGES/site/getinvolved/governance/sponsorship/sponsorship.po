"QGIS is an entirely Open Source project. QGIS development is carried out "
"largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, "
"valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. As a "
"result, you have free access to the source code and binaries that we provide"
" on our web site. As a result of this volunteer approach, a number of tasks,"
" less interesting or important for the developers, are sometimes left "
"behind. In addition, promoting QGIS requires our participation at congresses"
" and conferences and the production of information material, sometimes very "
"expensive for volunteer developers."
