"The options of each module shown in module's_*Options_*tab are created "

"Some GRASS modules have too many options which can be confusing for "
"beginners. In QGM it is possible to define only some of them and possibly "
"set some default values and/or hide some options with certain value. That "
"means that more QGIS-GRASS modules can be defined for each GRASS module. For"
" example the module r.to.vect was devided into three QGIS-GRASS modules with"
" predefined \"feature\" option.The QGM definition is written in XML format "
"file with extension .qgm, one for each QGIS-GRASS module. Configuration "
"files are stored in _*qgis/src/plugins/grass/modules*_ directory and "
"installed in _*share/qgis/grass/modules*_ directory. The name of the file "
"should start with GRASS module name + a word describing the specific task. "
