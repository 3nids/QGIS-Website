"only see for instance Segmentation fault and not ``Segmentation fault (core "
"dumped)`` in the shell you started QGIS from and you need to run ``ulimit -c"
" unlimited`` before starting QGIS. You could also include that in your "
"``.profile``. Start qgis from the shell and repeat the steps to reproduce "
"the crash. After the crash the core file will be located in the current "
"directory. To produce a backtrace from it you start ``gdb "
"/path/to/the/qgis/binary core``. The binary is usually ``/usr/bin/qgis`` or "
"``/usr/bin/qgis.bin`` on Debian with the GRASS plugin installed. In ``gdb`` "
