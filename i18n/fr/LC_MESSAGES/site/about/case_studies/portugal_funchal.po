"There will be democratic teaching in our schools or education communities "
"when we generalize the use of Open Source software. This demands not only a "
"change in people's way of thinking (sometimes molded by advertising), but "
"also a sustainable management of expenses and, indirectly, fighting against "
"software piracy. These advantages which are inherent to the philosophy of "
"the Open Source software will be the model to follow if we want a quality "
"education without boundaries or dependencies of any kind. From this "
"perspective, class 35 of the 12th grade belonging to the technological "
"course of territory and environment at Jaime Moniz Secondary School, uses "
"QGIS to develop activities proposed in Geographical Information Systems, "
"Applied Information Systems and during their training period. Within the "
"range of options of free GIS, there were three underlying reasons for the "
"choice of Open Source selection: the user friendly and intuitive approach, "
"supported by online information provided by forums; the several software "
"plug-ins and the quality of the product in its final stage. (One should bear"
" in mind that these academic works were done by students who belong to a "
"very young age group.)"
msgstr "L'enseignement sera démocratique dans nos écoles ou dans les communautés éducatives quand on aura généralisé l'utilisation de logiciels Open Source.  Cela exige d'abord un changement dans les mentalités des gens (influencés par la publicité) , mais aussi en assurant une une gestion durable des dépenses et indirectement en luttant contre le piratage de logiciels. Ces avantages inhérents à la philosophie du logiciel Open Source seront un modèle à suivre si nous voulons une éducation de qualité sans frontière ou dépendance quelconque. Dans cette perspective , la classe 35 de terminale appartenant au cours Technologie du territoire et de l'environnement au lycée Jaime Moniz, utilise QGIS pour développer des activités proposées en SIG, Systèmes d'Information Appliqués et au cours de leur stage. Dans la gamme des options de SIG libre, il y avait trois raisons sous-jacentes lors du choix de la solution Open Source : l'approche conviviale et intuitive, aidée par les informations disponible en ligne sur les forums ; les multiples plugins et la qualité du produit en phase finale (il faut garder à l'esprit que ces travaux académiques ont été réalisées par les étudiants assez jeunes)."

"Expectation was the most dominating feeling in the firth lessons! The group "
"of students had only a theoretical and somewhat vague knowledge about the "
"issue of GIS. It was, therefore, necessary to link practical activities to "
"that theoretical knowledge - at first, through the gathering of geographical"
" information by using a support map, within the school's perimeter, and "
"later, by using a GPS, concerning the area surrounding the school. In "
"figures 1 and 2 it is possible to view some of the activities developed in "
"class."

"make a Digital Elevation Model” and, last but not least, “to recognize the "

"In a flashback analysis of the whole process, I feel that the idea of using "
"QGIS, as a tool, to accomplish some teaching purposes, was an excellent "
"choice. At first, its use involved a lot of expectation. I had never used "
"GIS before and, therefore, I was learning and teaching at the same time. The"
" fact that the GIS turned out to be extremely user friendly together, with "
"the information available online, was a blessing for me. Moreover, the "
"school did not have to pay for another software license nor it was dependent"
" on license renewals, which substantially improved the teaching quality, "
"without any extra expenses. At present, students use QGIS almost on their "
"own to accomplish their different work plans. I hope the final result shows "
"the amount of effort involved in the whole learning process."
