(information available at :ref:`Donations <QGIS-donations>` page).
Even a small donation can make a difference and help to reach important project goals!

If you wish to send us a larger donation, you are strongly encouraged to use the
bank account rather than PayPal.

Donations to QGIS are tax-deductible in several countries.
Please refer to your local tax office for details.
