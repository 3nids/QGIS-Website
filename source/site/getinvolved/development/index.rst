Api Documentation
-----------------

You can find the API documentation for cpp here:

http://qgis.org/api/ (for QGIS testing)

http://qgis.org/api/2.0/ (for QGIS 2.0)

http://qgis.org/api/1.8/ (for QGIS 1.8)



Plugin Development
==================

QGIS has a plugin infrastructure. You can add a lot of new functionality by
writing your own plugins.

These plugins can either be written in C++ or in Python

Cpp plugin development
----------------------

To learn how to write your first cpp plugin, please go here: :ref:`QGIS-cpp-plugin-development`

Via a script you will generate a plugin stub which can be used further.



Python plugin development
-------------------------

QGIS has a lot to offer for python developers too.

QGIS has python bindings so you can automate tasks in QGIS via python.

Interested in python plugin development, go to :ref:`QGIS-python-plugin-development`
or have a look into the :ref:`PyQGIS-Developer-Cookbook`.

Looking for examples of python plugins, see http://plugins.qgis.org

You can find the QGIS-iface which you can use via python here:

http://qgis.org/api/classQgisInterface.html (for QGIS testing)

http://qgis.org/api/2.0/classQgisInterface.html (for QGIS 2.0)

http://qgis.org/api/1.8/classQgisInterface.html (for QGIS 1.8)
