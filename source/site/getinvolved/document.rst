Write Documentation
===================

The update of the QGIS documentation is managed by the :ref:`Community Team Lead <gui-translation>`.
Have a look at the :ref:`QGIS Governance <gui-translation>` to find out who is in charge 
of guiding you.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS documentation team can be found 
at www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html. A list of documenters can be found at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/graphs/contributors.

.. _mailinglist-translation-docs:

Documentation Mailing list
...........................

If you plan to contribute to an existing document and for other related questions, 
please contact the Documentation Team Leader (see :ref:`Organigram <gui-translation>`) or 
subscribe with the `qgis-community-team <http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-community-team>`_
mailing list.

After subscribing to the mailing list you are able to send a mail directly to
qgis-community-team@lists.osgeo.org asking for help.

We strongly encourage anyone dealing with documentation and its translations to 
join this list and promise that it is usually a very low traffic mailing list.

The other available mailing lists can be found at :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists`.

Becoming a documenter
.....................

The QGIS project is always looking for people who are willing to invest some
more time updating QGIS documentation and translating it into a foreign language 
- even perhaps to coordinate the update and translation effort.

We are trying to improve our project management process and spread the load
more evenly between people who each have a specific area of responsibility,
so any contribution you have to make will be greatly appreciated.

If you would like to nominate yourself as a coordinator for a manual, a single 
manual chapter or a language please go ahead. If more than one person 
nominate themselves as coordinator for the same document, please contact each 
other and resolve how you will manage your efforts.

Please :ref:`contact <community-resources>` the Community Assistant or the Doc
translation team leader to see your name entered in the About Box of QGIS.
