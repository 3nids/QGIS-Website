Write Documentation
===================

The update of the QGIS documentation is managed by the :ref:`Community Team Lead <gui-translation>`.
Have a look at the :ref:`QGIS Governance <gui-translation>` to find out who is in charge 
of guiding you.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS documentation team can be found 
at http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html. A list of documenters can be found at 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/graphs/contributors.

.. _becoming-documenter:

Becoming a documenter
---------------------

The QGIS project is always looking for people who are willing to invest some
more time updating QGIS documentation and translating it into a foreign language 
- even perhaps to coordinate the update and translation effort.

We are trying to improve our project management process and spread the load
more evenly between people who each have a specific area of responsibility,
so any contribution you have to make will be greatly appreciated.

The complete list of documents managed by the QGIS documentation team can be found 
at http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html.
All the documentation sources are hosted in `QGIS-Documentation Github repository
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation>`_. If you want to update some features
in QGIS or document new ones, you need to:

- have a Github account
- fork the repository
- do your changes and submit pull request
  
You can find a few guidelines that will help you manage these processes at :ref:`git_access`. 

.. note:: 
  A ``Fix me`` link provided at the bottom of any page of the Testing documentation
  helps you directly update the page in your fork and submit pull request.
