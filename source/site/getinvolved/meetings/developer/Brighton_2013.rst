10th QGIS Developer Meeting in Brighton
=======================================

The 10th QGIS Developer Meeting from 12 - 16 September 2013 was organised by `Lutra Consulting <http://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/>`_ and held at `University of Sussex <http://www.sussex.ac.uk/>`_ in Brighton, Great Britain. The University sponsored the venue and internet access. We are extremely grateful to them for organising and helping us to make the whole event went very smoothly. 

We also want to thank our gold sponsor `ASIA AIR SURVEY <http://www.asiaairsurvey.com/>`_, our silver sponsors `G.A.I.A. mbH <http://www.gaia-mbh.de>`_, and `State of Vorarlberg <http://www.vorarlberg.at/>`_, the German `FOSSGIS e.V. <http://www.fossgis.de/>`_ for sponsoring this event explicitly with 1500 Euros and the many people who have donated sums large and small to the QGIS project.

The money from donations was put to very good use funding the travel, accomodation and eating of most of the participants of the developer meeting. We would like to thank the virtual particpants present on IRC, the developer meeting was all the better for having your comments, testing and insights.

Summary of what happened at the hackfest
========================================

Firstly we should mention, that the greatest part of the time was spent in discussions. Meeting face to face gives us an opportunity to discuss the minutae of the project in a way that is imply not possible in our virtual discussions. The discussions also gave us a good chance to plan what should be the priorities after the major release of QGIS 2.0. More details on that further down. We had 46 people attending (though not all could be here for the full duration). They have been working on a wide variety of topics, e.g.:

Experiences and plans for the next hackfest
===========================================

The next hackfest is planned to be in spring 2014. We would like to encourage all developers and non developers to join the meeting because it was extremely useful having them in Brighton and there are many hackfest activities they can contribute with including documentation cleanups, translations, giving inputs to the user interface and user interaction ideas.
