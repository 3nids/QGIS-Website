How to ask a QGIS question?
...........................

If you are going to ask QGIS related question via the mailinglists,
please provide the following information with it:

- preferably a descriptive title for your email
- which Operating System and version
- which QGIS version you used at that moment (exact)
- how you installed it (osgeo4w? standalone-installer? own build?)
- at what time did it break (reinstall, new install, system update, project??)
- what exactly is the error (if possible: screendump, stacktrace, copy of errortext)

Without this info, it is very hard to answer for anybody. 
Or, taking just too much time because the answer will be a question to you etc etc.

Can I open ECW files with QGIS?
...............................

Yes you can... BUT depending on your Operating System, it is more or less difficult.

If you use the OSGeo4w 64 bit installer, it is included.
