Paolo Cavallini

Rationale
===================================
To make our decision making process, making it faster and more transparent, the proposal is:
* One PSC member raise on the PSC mailing list a topic to be decided.
* If the proponent believes the discussion in ML is sufficient, the member calls for a vote.
* If not, the member adds the point to the next PSC voice meeting, where it will be discussed and voted.
* Once voted, the member passes the decision to the Secretary, who adds the resolution to the list of resolutions.
