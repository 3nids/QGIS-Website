Proponent
===================================
Paolo Cavallini

Rationale
===================================
To make our meetings more productive, the proposal is:

* Regular meeting once a month, at a fixed date ad hoc short meetings are encouraged, 
  and can be called anytime to discuss single issues and to have faster decisions and avoid too long regular meetings; 
  only a subset of the PSC members can be present at the ad hoc meetings, if they are not interested in that specific topic; 
  their vote will be counted as +0. A PSC member can block an ad hoc meeting if he feels strongly about participating 
  but has not a time slot available. In this case it will be postponed to the monthly standard meeting.
* Every meeting will appoint a Chair, normally the PSC Chair, and a Secretary (not necessarily always the same person), 
  who will have the responsibility for completing the minutes; cooperative editing should be allowed.
