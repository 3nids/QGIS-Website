**When you can use the QGIS trademark without asking for a permission**

In cases of fair use, you may use or refer to QGIS trademark without an explicit permission from us. For instance::

* If you write articles, books, blog articles, tutorials, study materials for university, and similar, you do not need a permission to cite QGIS name and use the logo in it

.. note:: We require you to give attribution to the QGIS project and reference the project website somewhere in your book, article, etc. This could be a short paragraph in the Introduction or Preface

* If you give a course on QGIS, either academic, free, or commercial, you can use the logo and the name in course material

.. note:: Please avoid confusing terms like "QGIS manual", or anything that may give the impression of an official QGIS product, or is misleading

**Examples of use requiring a permission**

Some uses of QGIS require the user to obtain a permission. For instance::

* If you plan to market a QGIS-based product or service to the public using a trademark that includes the element "QGIS," such as "Super QGIS" or "Professional QGIS" you are required to apply for and obtain a permission from the QGIS Project Steering Committee (QGIS-PSC). This is true whether or not you apply to register your trademark with a government
* If you use QGIS trademark in a domain name, with or without commercial intent

If you need a permission, please write to our Financial and Marketing Advisor (trademark@qgis.org).

A permission is not a formal endorsement of QGIS project and doesn't mean anything about quality of the service.

**Examples of unacceptable uses**

* You cannot use QGIS trademark in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by the QGIS project or community, if the same is not true
* You cannot use QGIS trademark in a company or commercial organization name

Frequently Asked Questions 
-----------------------------

**Q:** *Do I need a permission?*

**A:** You need to apply for a permission if you are using the term “QGIS” as part of your own trademark or brand identifier for QGIS-based software goods or services. It doesn’t matter if your trademark is unregistered, or if you do not plan to make any money using the mark.

**Q:** *When do I have to show proper attribution?*

**A:** Whenever and however you use the term QGIS in print, on the internet, or in audio broadcasts, you should always give proper attribution to QGIS project. For more information see “Trademark Attribution.”

**Q:** *I am registering or have registered a trademark with my country's trademark authority. Do I still need a permission?*

**A:** Yes, assuming your trademark includes the element QGIS and it is being used in connection with software-related goods and services. Please note, the permission applies to QGIS trademark whether or not they are registered with a trademark authority. If you are using the term QGIS as a trademark (whether or not registered), you need to apply for a permission.

**Q:** *I am a commercial entity (for example, a company, partnership or sole proprietor, profit or non-profit) selling software-related goods or services and using the word "QGIS" in the entity’s name. Do I need to apply for a permission?*

**A:** Yes, because you are using QGIS as part of a trademark in connection with software-related goods or services. Software-related goods are computer programs and systems, or packages bundling software with tools, utilities, hardware, etc. Software-related services are services that deploy, document, facilitate the use of, or enhance computer programs and systems.

Even if you don’t use QGIS as part of the entity’s name, if the entity has a product or service (whether sold or given away for free) that uses "QGIS" in its name, you still need a permission for the use of the word QGIS in the name of the products or services.

**Q:** *If I get a permission for my trademark, will QGIS refuse to grant similar permissions to marks that are the same as, or confusingly similar to, my mark?*

**A:** No, QGIS will not attempt to ensure exclusivity or protect marks from infringement. QGIS considers the protection of trademarks against infringement to be the responsibility of the trademark owner. QGIS is not a dispute resolution authority, and does not become involved in disputes between trademark owners.

**Q:** *Trademark Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register a trademark for software-related goods or services that includes QGIS as an element. The application was rejected for confusing similarity to QGIS trademark. If I enter into a permission, will QGIS consent to my registration?*

**A:** No. The QGIS permission is not a consent for the registration of other trademarks. To protect the QGIS mark from dilution, we do not consent to the registration of trademarks found to be confusingly similar to the QGIS mark.

**Q:** *Domain Name Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register an internet domain name which includes the element QGIS. If we enter into a permission, will QGIS consent to our registration?*

**A:** QGIS and the QGIS permission have no control over the registration of domain names, which are distinct from trademarks (see related FAQs above). QGIS does not oppose the registration of domain names. You do not need a permission to use a domain name which includes QGIS, unless you use your QGIS domain name as a trademark.
