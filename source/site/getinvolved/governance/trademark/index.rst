More info
----------

The QGIS name and logo are now protected under European law from unauthorized and confusing uses of the trademark [https://oami.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/012702643]. We can authorize proper uses of the mark upon request. Please write to our Financial and Marketing Advisor (cavallini@faunalia.it).

In cases of fair use, members of the public may use or refer to a registered trademark without a license from the owner.

**Examples of Fair Use:**

If you are a journalist interested in writing articles that include the term QGIS, you do not need a sublicense.

Some uses of QGIS require the user to obtain a sublicense.

**Examples of Use Requiring A Sublicense:**

If you plan to market a QGIS-based product or service to the public using a trademark that includes the element "QGIS," such as "Super QGIS" or "Professional QGIS" you are required to apply for and obtain a sublicense from QGIS-PSC. This is true whether or not you apply to register your trademark with a government.

A sublicence is not a formal endorsement of QGIS project and doesn't mean anything about quality of the service.

Frequently Asked Questions 
-----------------------------

**Q:** *Do I need a sublicense?*

**A:** You need to apply for a sublicense if you are using the term “QGIS” as part of your own trademark or brand identifier for QGIS-based software goods or services. It doesn’t matter if your trademark is unregistered, or if you do not plan to make any money using the mark.

Answering the following questions (which break out each of the key issues) may help you determine if you need a sublicense from QGIS. If you are still in doubt, please contact QGIS and we will work with you to determine whether you need to apply for a sublicense.

If the answer to all three of the following questions is “yes,” then you need to apply for a sublicense. If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” then you do not need to apply for a sublicense.

* Is my mark a trademark (see how we define “trademark,” below)?
* Does my mark contain the following string of adjacent letters, in this order: “QGIS”? These letters may or may not be capitalized, and in the case of foreign characters, phonetic translations also apply.
*  Do I use my mark to identify software-related goods or services (see how that phrase is defined, below)?

**Q:** *What is a trademark?*

**A:** The definition of “trademark” varies somewhat from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, a trademark is a name used in public to identify the source of specific goods and services. Trademark rights can be used to prevent others from using a similar mark to identify a source of similar goods and services. If you are unsure whether you are using a trademark, you should speak with someone familiar with the law where you are located.

**Q:** *I am the registered owner of an internet domain which includes the term "QGIS." Do I need a sublicense?*

**A:** The QGIS Sublicense Agreement applies only to trademarks, but we recognize that internet domains are sometimes used as trademarks. If you are using your domain name as a trademark, then you will need a sublicense from QGIS. For help determining whether your domain is a trademark, see the questions and answers at the top of this FAQ page.

**Q:** *When do I have to show proper attribution?*

A: Whenever and however you use the term QGIS in print, on the internet, or in audio broadcasts, you should always give proper attribution to QGIS project. For more information see “Trademark Attribution.”

**Q:** *I am registering or have registered a trademark with my country's trademark authority. Do I still need a sublicense?*

**A:** Yes, assuming your trademark includes the element QGIS and it is being used in connection with software-related goods and services. Please note, the Sublicense applies to QGIS trademarks whether or not they are registered with a trademark authority. If you are using the term QGIS as a trademark (whether or not registered), you need to apply for a sublicense.

**Q:** *I am a commercial entity (for example, a company, partnership or sole proprietor, profit or non-profit) selling software-related goods or services and using the word "QGIS" in the entity’s name. Do I need to apply for a sublicense?*

**A:** Yes, because you are using QGIS as part of a trademark in connection with software-related goods or services. Software-related goods are computer programs and systems, or packages bundling software with tools, utilities, hardware, etc. Software-related services are services that deploy, document, facilitate the use of, or enhance computer programs and systems.

Even if you don’t use QGIS as part of the entity’s name, if the entity has a product or service (whether sold or given away for free) that uses "QGIS" in its name, you still need a sublicense for the use of the word QGIS in the name of the products or services.

**Q:** *If I sublicense my trademark, will QGIS refuse to sublicense marks that are the same as, or confusingly similar to, my sublicensed mark?*

**A:** No, QGIS will not attempt to ensure exclusivity or protect sublicensee marks from infringement. QGIS considers the protection of trademarks against infringement to be the responsibility of the trademark owner. QGIS is not a dispute resolution authority, and does not become involved in disputes between trademark owners.

**Q:** *Trademark Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register a trademark for software-related goods or services that includes QGIS as an element. The application was rejected for confusing similarity to QGIS trademark. If I enter into a sublicense, will QGIS consent to my registration?*

**A:** No. The QGIS Sublicense Agreement is not a consent for the registration of sublicensed trademarks. To protect the QGIS mark from dilution, we do not consent to the registration of trademarks found to be confusingly similar to the QGIS mark.

**Q:** *Domain Name Registration Consent: My organization has applied to register an internet domain name which includes the element QGIS. If we enter into a sublicense, will QGIS consent to our registration?*

**A:** QGIS and the QGIS Sublicense Agreement have no control over the registration of domain names, which are distinct from trademarks (see related FAQs above). QGIS does not oppose the registration of domain names. You do not need a sublicense to use a domain name which includes QGIS, unless you use your QGIS domain name as a trademark.
