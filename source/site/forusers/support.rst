Mailing Lists
-------------

QGIS has a bunch of mailing lists. See :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists` for the different available lists.

If you are going to ask questions please read this: :ref:`how-to-ask-a-QGIS-question`.


Searchable Mailing Lists
------------------------

Nabble (http://nabble.com) keeps a history of a lot of mailinglists. 

If you go to
the osgeo section of it: http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/ you see there is a
QGIS section also, where you can do a search over all QGIS lists, or refine it
to eg only the users list.


Forums
------

QGIS does not have a forum. Please either search in StackExchange (see below),
or via http://nabble.com in the history of our Mailinglists (see above)


StackExchange
-------------

On http://gis.stackexchange.com you can ask QGIS questions also. If you use the 
tag 'qgis' you'll see all QGIS related questions and answer:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/?tags=qgis


Chat
----

A lot of the development buzz will be spoken on IRC. 

There is a #qgis channel on freenode.net

You can also use a web interface: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#qgis 

User Groups
-----------

Goals of a user group
......................
 
* Organization of user meetings
* Coordination of development, taking into account regional/national standards and requirements
* QGIS information: meetings, articles in GIS magazines, QGIS information in social media, GIS discussion boards, etc.
* Collection of case studies of local QGIS usage
* Sponsoring: a local user group could collect reasonable annual membership fees (depending on the country). This collected funds could be used to pay development of certain features, to help with bug-fixing or as a donation to the international QGIS project.
* establishment of interest groups, e.g. surveying, urban planning, server/web client, etc.
* initialization/coordination of application modules, e.g. surveying, urban planning, server/web client, etc.
 
General assumptions/recommendations
....................................
 
* stay vendor/company neutral
* establish democratic structures for the steering committee, voting and important decision
* stay transparent, esp. if you deal with membership-fees and how you spend it
* inform the international project from time to time about your local activities

Organization
............

Depending on your country, a smaller legal entity, e.g. an association, could be established. Depending on local legislation such an entity implies that you meet at least once per year (general assembly), publish a yearly report and make the financial report available to your members. Often it also implies the creation of statutes.
 
Statutes of the Swiss QGIS user group as an example:

* german (master): http://www.qgis.ch/de/verein/statuten-der-qgis-anwendergruppe-schweiz
* english (translation): http://www.qgis.ch/en/association/statutes-of-the-swiss-qgis-user-group
* french (translation): http://www.qgis.ch/fr/association/statuts-du-groupe-d2019utilisateurs-qgis-suisse
 
Membership application forms:

* german: http://www.qgis.ch/de/verein/beitrittserklaerung
* english: http://www.qgis.ch/en/association/qgis-usergroup-switzerland-membership-application-form
* french: http://www.qgis.ch/fr/association/declaration-d2019adhesion
 
You can use these statutes and membership application forms as an idea
or reference and change them to your local situation.
 
Local Country domain qgis.xx
.............................

It is recommended to register your local country domains, e.g. qgis.ch or qgis.uk. If the domain is already taken by someone other organization, company or person please negotiate if you can transfer the owner to the local QGIS user group. The QGIS international project has registered QGIS as a trademark, which should help you during your negotations.
 
Website
........

The website should be used to publish any material in relation to the information and management of the user group. Examples include the user meetings, case study, shared material, discussion boards, etc. Public material should be available without login requirements (e.g. do not require interested people to be a member of a social media network like Facebook or Google+). Usage of social media is recommended but should not be the only channel of information. RSS feeds should be made available at the Website of the QGIS user group.
 
 
Good luck with the organization of your local user group. Please inform the international QGIS team by registering at the QGIS community list and reporting about your progress. Please do not hesitate to ask questions regarding the establishment and maintenance of your local user group.
