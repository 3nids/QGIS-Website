QGIS has a bunch of mailing lists. See :ref:`QGIS-mailinglists` for the different available lists.

If you are going to ask questions please read this: :ref:`how-to-ask-a-QGIS-question`.


Searchable Mailing Lists
------------------------

Nabble (http://nabble.com) keeps a history of a lot of mailinglists. 

If you go to
the osgeo section of it: http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/ you see there is a
QGIS section also, where you can do a search over all QGIS lists, or refine it
to eg only the users list.

QGIS does not have a forum. Please either search in StackExchange (see below),
or via http://nabble.com in the history of our Mailinglists (see above)


StackExchange

A lot of the development buzz will be spoken on IRC.
