QGIS Installers
===============

How to obtain QGIS?

QGIS is freely available on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, BSD, and Android.

.. warning:: QGIS testing versions are provided for some platforms in
   addition to the QGIS stable version.
   QGIS testing contains unreleased software that is currently being worked
   on.
   As such they are unsupported and only provided for testing purposes to
   early adopters to check if bugs have been resolved and that no new bugs
   have been introduced.
   At any given time it may not work, or may do bad things to your data. Use
   at your own risk.
   You have been warned!

Windows
=======

For Windows installers please go to
`The main installers page <./download.html>`_.

For new users we recommend the standalone installers.

For more advanced QGIS users you can use the OSGeo4W package, which makes it
possible to install both the latest stable version and/or the development
(nightly) version (but not the warning above!).

The OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects.
QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc.
The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed
packages beforehand.
The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations.
Steps are::

 Download OSGEO4W Installer
 Start it
 Select **Advanced Install** and then the *qgis* or *qgis-dev* package from
 the Desktop section.
 Also other libraries can be selected.

Linux
=====

Most linux distributions split QGIS into several packages; you'll probably
need qgis and qgis-python (to run plugins).
Packages like qgis-grass (or qgis-plugin-grass), qgis-mapserver can be
skipped initially, or installed only when you need them.

Below you find instructions to install per distribution.
For most distro's there are instructions to install QGIS stable and
instructions to install a cutting edge QGIS testing build (but mind the
warning above!).

Ubuntu
------

Default Ubuntu software repositories often hold older versions of QGIS.

To have newer versions, you have to add alternative software repositories, by
adding one of the deb-lines below to your /etc/apt/sources.list file.
Or add these repositories via your favourite Ubuntu software installation GUI.

Then type::

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis

If you want the GRASS plugin make sure to install the optional package::

 sudo apt-get install qgis-plugin-grass

In case of keyserver errors add the qgis.org repository public key to
your apt keyring, type::

 gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 47765B75
 gpg --export --armor 47765B75 | sudo apt-key add -

Base on dependencies from ubuntugis:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are also nightly builds that depend on updated dependencies found in
ubuntugis.
Be sure to remove the http://qgis.org/debian ones first, otherwise you'll end
up with a mix of dependencies.

Raring::

Debian
------

QGIS stable
...........

Packages for Debian *Wheezy, Jessie and Unstable* for i386 and amd64 are
available at:

Wheezy (7.x)::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian wheezy main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian wheezy main

Jessie (8.x; testing, not yet released)::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian jessie main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian jessie main

Unstable::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian sid main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian sid main


.. note:: The packages are only produced once shortly after a new version has
   been released.  As unstable and not yet released debian versions can have
   library changes the packages might sooner or later be broken, when the
   development in debian moves on.  If that's the case you can either move to a
   stable debian version and use the released packages for it, rebuild the
   packages for the current state of debian (see INSTALL) or switch to the
   testing packages which are rebuild on regular basis.

To add the the http://qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring,
type::

 gpg --recv-key 47765B75
 gpg --export --armor 47765B75 | sudo apt-key add -

Then add the lines for one of the repositories to your
``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file (see below to choose the appropriate one) and
type::

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass

.. note:: Please remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have
   installed from other repositories before doing the update.


QGIS testing
............

Nightly builds of QGIS testing are available from following repository (i386
and amd64):

Wheezy (7.x)::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly wheezy main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly wheezy main

Jessie (8.x)::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly jessie main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly jessie main

Sid (Unstable)::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian-nightly sid main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian-nightly sid main

Although the nightly builds can be used to test newer versions,
they are mainly meant to test, if the newer qgis versions still build fine on
the various distributions using the various (older) versions of libraries
found there.
Therefore it is not intended to build versions that depend on more current
libraries.
That means if you need current qgis version with more up to date libraries
you will have to build them yourself.
