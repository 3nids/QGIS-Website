QGIS Installers
===============

How to obtain QGIS?

QGIS is freely available on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, BSD, and Android.

We recommend installing the packages of the released software.

To evaluate the upcoming release and to allow non-developers to support
development we also provide testing packages (note the
warning_).

In the feature frozen phase preceding a release (see
:ref:`QGIS-release-schedule`) these packages are effectively **pre-releases,
which we strongly urge users to test**.

.. _QGIS-windows-testing:

Windows
=======

For Windows installers please go to
`The main installers page <./download.html>`_.

For new users we recommend the standalone installers.

For more advanced QGIS users you can use the OSGeo4W package, which makes it
possible to install several versions in parallel.

The OSGeo4W repository contains a lot of software from OSGeo projects.
QGIS and all dependencies are included, along with Python, GRASS, GDAL, etc.
The installer is able to install from internet or just download all needed
packages beforehand.
The downloaded files are kept in a local directory for future installations.
Steps are:

- Download OSGeo4W Installer and start it

- Select *Advanced Install*,

- navigate to the *Desktop* section and

- and pick one or more of the following packages:

  +-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | Version           | Package      | Description                                           |
  +===================+==============+=======================================================+
  | Latest Release    | qgis         | Release                                               |
  |                   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  |                   | qgis-rel-dev | Nightly build of the upcoming point release           |
  +-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | Long Term Release | qgis-ltr     | Release                                               |
  | (available once   +--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | there is a new    | qgis-ltr-dev | Nightly build of the upcoming point long term release |
  | latest release)   |              |                                                       |
  +-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | Development       | qgis-dev     | Nightly build of the development version              |
  +-------------------+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

.. _QGIS-windows-weekly:

For users that cannot use OSGeo4W for some reason or just prefer it there is
also a `weekly snapshot <http://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/?C=M;O=D>`_ of
qgis-dev from OSGeo4W as *standalone installer* (taken on monday).  In the
feature freeze phase that also acts as **release candidate**.

Note the warning_.

.. note:: Don't blindly do a full install of OSGeo4W. Only install QGIS and
   maybe other components you like.  Dependencies will be included
   automatically.  A full install pulls in components that require third party
   additions, which need to be installed manually.  These components render the
   installation unusable without those additions.

Linux
=====

Most linux distributions split QGIS into several packages; you'll probably
need qgis and qgis-python (to run plugins).
Packages like qgis-grass (or qgis-plugin-grass), qgis-server can be
skipped initially, or installed only when you need them.

Below you find instructions to install per distribution.  For most distro's
there are instructions to install QGIS stable and instructions to install a
cutting edge QGIS testing build (note the warning_).


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

Default Debian and Ubuntu software repositories often hold older versions of
QGIS.

To have newer versions, you have to add alternative software repositories, by
adding one of the deb-lines below to your /etc/apt/sources.list file.

We provide multiple lines of packages for several version of Debian and Ubuntu.

Lines of packages:

Add the lines for one of the repositories to your ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

 deb     *repository* *codename* main
 deb-src *repository* *codename* main

Example latest release for Debian wheezy::

 deb     http://qgis.org/debian wheezy main
 deb-src http://qgis.org/debian wheezy main

If you want packages based on ubuntugis dependencies you also need to add
following lines::

 deb     http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu *codename* main

After that type::

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass

.. note:: Please remove all the QGIS and GRASS packages you may have
   installed from other repositories before doing the update.

In case of keyserver errors add the qgis.org repository public key to
your apt keyring, type::

 gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv DD45F6C3
 gpg --export --armor DD45F6C3 | sudo apt-key add -

There is an alternative repository for QGIS 2.8.1 on Fedora 20 and Fedora 21
::

 sudo wget fedora.vitu.ch/QGIS/qgis.repo -P /etc/yum.repos.d/
 sudo rpm --import http://fedora.vitu.ch/Fedora/RPM-GPG-Key-vitu
