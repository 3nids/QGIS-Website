In this directory page, you can get listed if you provide FREE training material
for QGIS.

The general idea is to be able to (re)use material from each other.

Educators are encouraged to use/mix/add material to the QGIS Training Manual.

Please write to richard@qgis.org if you want to have something added here.
Or you edit this page in github and do a pull request.
